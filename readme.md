# Mathematical Models for Scheduling Problems

This repository is dedicated to exploring and solving scheduling optimization problems using mathematical modeling techniques. We leverage powerful optimization solvers such as Gurobi, Google OR-Tools, among others, to tackle various scheduling optimization challenges.

## Supported Problems
Our project covers a wide range of scheduling optimization problems, including but not limited to:

- Job Shop Scheduling
- Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling problem (RCPSP)

## Contributing
